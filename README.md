# The-Karna-Robot
I'm making a Robot. This is a long term personal project. In these times of AI powered Robots (like Sophia Robot, Boston Dynamics etc), very soon big companies will launch capable robots for household purposes. I do not aim to buy any of those. So I am buidling one of my own.
I have some experience in various technologies, embedded systesm, Python, Web, ML and practical physics, but in no way I'm an expert in any of these fields. I intend to make use of all these technologies during the development of Karna Robot.
I am  regularly updating development here - http://ankurtiwari.co/the-karna-robot/
